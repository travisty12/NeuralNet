# Neural Net

#### Two classes meant to aid in quickly building a neural network of any size and depth.

### Travis Scott

* All concepts used in this program were learned from Michael Nielsen's book *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*, found [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). This repo is just a translation of stochastic gradient descent concepts shown in the book in Python, into JavaScript, along with a second class built to handle tensor math (previously handled by NumPy)
* I understand that TensorFlow.js exists for this, but I just thought it would be a fun challenge to write the math and network creation myself!
